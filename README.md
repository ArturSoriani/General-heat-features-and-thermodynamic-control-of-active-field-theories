Artur Soriani, Elsen Tjhung, Ã‰tienne Fodor, and Artur Soriani

## Description
Python script required to required to reproduce all numerical simulations presented in the paper General heat features and thermodynamic control of active field theories.

Source code by Artur Soriani.

## How to run
In a terminal with python 3.10.2, use

'python CMB.py a0 atau b phibar betaF betaDelta'

where

'a0' is the initial value of the external parameter;

'atau' is the final value of the external parameter;

'b' is the constant multiplying the phi^4 term in the free energy;

'phibar' is the conserved global density;

'betaF' is inverse temeprature times initial free energy of the homogeneous solution per lattice site;

'betaDelta' is inverse temperature times activity parameter.
